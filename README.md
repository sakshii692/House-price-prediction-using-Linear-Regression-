# House-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression-

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using Linear Regression in Python.
The model is trained on a housing dataset and predicts house prices based on input features.
The goal of this project is to:
Understand data preprocessing
Build and train a regression model
Evaluate performance using MSE & R² Score
Predict prices for new house data
